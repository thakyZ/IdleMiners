  "description" : "Patch Note: 0.1.3.1: Added a scan discription onto all miners, Removed Liquid Erchius Fuel from Luner Recipe, adjusted the recipes again slightly\n\nThese Miners where removed from ISE4-R and brought back as a seperate mod, for the people who like to idle around, and/or want something to generate ores whiles out and about.\nUses \"Harvestables\" code, which means they will still work, even whiles your away, No ore restrictions, No planet restriction, works even on the ship (because, logic?), Generates ores based on level/planet type, an Electric Miner Mk.2 will drop Iron ore, as well as Tungsten, and so on\n\nHave Fun :)\n\nBurner Miner can be crafted by hand with minimal recipe, so you dont even need to forge bars to make it\nElectric Miner Mk.1, Mk.2 and Luna Miner, are made by Inventers Table Mk.1\nElectric Miner Mk.3, Mk.4 & Electic Salvager, are made by Inventers Table Mk.2\nElectric Miner Mk.5 and Mk.6 are made by Inventers Table Mk.3\n\nEach miner (except the Burner Miner) needs previous miners as recipes\n\n\nFAQ: (20/05/2017)\nQ: How do i obtain ores from the machines?\nA: You have to wait till the didgital clock reaches 100%, then the frame of the machine will become active with a white frame, pressing E on it, will drop all the drops, like a crop does\n\nQ: Why like a crop?\nA: The Machine uses the Harvestible code, so its treated like a plant, each frame adds 1% to the didgital clock, making it use 100 frames, thus, once it reaches 100%, the crop is ready to harvest\n\nQ: Can't you use the Mining code from ISE4-R\nA: I Could, but that would remove the unique set from ISE4, i'd rather leave it like this, besides, this code type, allows the machine to generate even whiles your away, so no fuss with power, or to over look it whiles its busy\n\n\nCheck out my Other mods :)\nIndustrialization Starbound Edition 4 - Reconstruction (ISE4-R): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764435427\n\nChucklefish Version:\nhttp://community.playstarbound.com/resources/idle-miners.4597/",
